          <p>
            The first project is related to develop a single Web page using only
            two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists on creating a
            single web page with a menu at the top know as Navitation Bar. We
            have to include text describing ourself and text describing the
            project. Additionally, we need to include two images: one image is
            of ourself and second image is anything related to the project
            itself.
